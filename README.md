I have created this app using React i have used fetch commands to fetch the data from API and deploy it into the website
I have used Card and row of CSS to design the area of information

To run this on your local computer. us command "npm imstall"
this will install all dependencies on your computer

Then use "npm start" to deploy this website on localhost
